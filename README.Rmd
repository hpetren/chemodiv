# chemodiv

`chemodiv` is an R package for analysing chemodiversity of phytochemical data

The package can be used to calculate various types of diversities and 
dissimilarities for phytochemical datasets. This includes the use of diversity
indices and dissimilarity indices that incorporate the biosynthetic and/or 
structural properties of the phytochemical compounds for the calculations,
resulting in comprehensive measures of phytochemical diversity.
A complete description of the package is available in Petrén et al. 2023.


## Installation

The current version of the package can be installed from CRAN. 
Importantly, the `chemodiv` package partly depends on packages from Bioconductor. 
Therefore, it is recommended to install the package via the `install()` function in 
the `BiocManager` package, rather than using the default 
`install.packages("chemodiv")`. This will ensure all dependencies are
correctly installed as well.

**Install current version from CRAN**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("BiocManager") # Install BiocManager if not already installed
library("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("chemodiv")
```

**The package can also be installed from GitHub**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools") # Install devtools if not already installed
library("devtools")
install_github("hpetren/chemodiv")
```


## Usage

Detailed usage notes can be found with `help(chemodiv)` and in the 
documentation for each function. See the vignette for a worked example.
In short, two datasets are required. First, a dataset on
the relative relative abundance/concentration (i.e. proportion) of
different phytochemical compounds in different samples. Second, a dataset 
with the compound name, SMILES and InChIKey for all the compounds in 
the first dataset. The following functions can then be used:


#### Data formatting checks
Function `chemoDivCheck()` checks so that the datasets used by functions 
in the package are correctly formatted.


#### Compound classification and dissimilarities
Function `NPCTable()` uses the deep-learning tool *NPClassifier* to classify
chemical compounds into groups largely corresponding to biosynthetic pathways.
The function `compDis()` calculates and outputs a list of dissimilarity 
matrices with pairwise dissimilarities between chemical compounds, based on 
their biosynthetic and/or structural properties.


#### Diversity calculations
Functions `calcDiv()`, `calcBetaDiv()` and `calcDivProf()` are used to 
calculate phytochemical diversity in different ways, using both traditional 
indices and Hill numbers. `calcDiv()` calculates alpha diversity and evenness. 
`calcBetaDiv()` calculates beta diversity. `calcDivProf()` generates 
diversity profiles. Calculations of functional Hill numbers utilize a
dissimilarity matrix generated by the `compDis()` function.


#### Sample dissimilarities
Function `sampDis()` is used to calculate Generalized UniFrac dissimilarities
or Bray-Curtis dissimilarities between samples. Calculations of Generalized 
UniFrac dissimilarities utilizes dissimilarity matrix generated by
the `compDis()` function.


#### Molecular network and properties
Function `molNet()` creates a molecular network of the chemical compounds
and calculates some network properties using matrices generated by
the `compDis()` function.


#### Chemodiversity and network plots
`molNetPlot()` and `chemoDivPlot()` are used to conveniently create basic plots 
of the molecular network and different types phytochemical diversity and 
dissimilarity calculated by the other functions in the package.


#### Shortcut function
Function `quickChemoDiv()` uses many of the other functions in
the package to in one simple step calculate and visualize chemodiversity for
users wanting to quickly explore their data using standard parameters.
